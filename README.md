version of chrome? I guess you should have it already installed.
then, you should visit this page

// download chrome from here http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html

and download appropriate chromedriver version, same as your installed Chrome browser.
Additionally, you should have Node.js installed (> 10 version).

Then, you should copy your cookies, from all-access.wax.io in JSON format. You can use EditThisCookie chrome extension. Insert that data as 1.json file in cookies folder.

Run chromedriver (double click on downloaded file)
Run project by running command in terminal (cmd for Windows) npm start
(Only first time, you should run npm install before start)
